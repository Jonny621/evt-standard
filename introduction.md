# Introduction of EVT

EVT(Encrypted Variable Token) is a new token standard applied in more broader fields than NFT. 

EVT supports the variable and encrypted data types which is well fit for Web3, metaverse applications.



## Why EVT

In recent years,  NFT based applications is blooming by acceleration of ERC-721 standard.

But current standards is still limited to few applicable fields such as digital arts because of the aspects below.

* Privacy and copyright protection.

  Because image, audio, video in NFT is totally opening, some important applications such as digital entertainment, social network, etc. , will be not emerging. 

* Variable Property

  Normally the metadata of NFT is  invariable. It impede the inovation based on blockchain.

* Industry metadata

We propose a new token standard EVT(Encrypted Variable Token) which support the development of encrypted and variable decentralized applications.
